# Agentic-development-examples
This repository contains real examples of how I have used agentic development to build software. The examples showcase various agents, workflows, and integrations that demonstrate the capabilities of agentic development. The examples are intended to inspire and guide others in their own agentic development projects. They have been modified to remove any sensitive information.


## Examples

- [Messagebus Refinement](Chat%20examples/messagebus-refinement.md): An example of using a refinement agent to enhance a PBI for setting up a message broker service in a deployment pipeline.
- [Chat Example Formatter Agent](.github/agents/chat-example-formatter.agent.md): An agent that formats chat example markdown files for better readability by adding context sections and visual separation between messages.
